They should start making these flavored… I can definitely see a market for it.
I’m having a midlife crisis every 20 seconds.

I’m an old soul.
Eat them while they’re young!
I stand on the shoulders of babies.
These babies are asking for an offer they can’t refuse.
A baby. Shaken, not stirred.
You are what you eat :)
